# Cancer Mortality Prediction Project README

## Overview:
This project aims to predict cancer mortality rates in US counties using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains various demographic and medical features of US counties, consolidated from census data. The project is divided into four parts, each focusing on different aspects of regression modeling.

## Repository Structure:
- `data/`: Contains the dataset files (`cancer_us_county-training.csv` and `cancer_us_county-testing.csv`).
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for each part of the assignment.
  - `Part_A_Univariate_Linear_Regression.ipynb`
  - `Part_B_Multivariate_Linear_Regression.ipynb`
  - `Part_C_Experiment_On_Multivariate_Linear_Regression_With_Feature_Engineering.ipynb`
- `EXPERIMENT REPORT`: Contains experiment reports in Word format.
  - `EXPERIMENT REPORT - Part A`
  - `EXPERIMENT REPORT - Part B`
  - `EXPERIMENT REPORT - Part C`
- `FINAL REPORT - Part D`: Contains final report in Word format for the project.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project (this file).
